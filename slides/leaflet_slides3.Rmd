# Intro to Spatial Data

* Everything happens somewhere!

--
* We represent spatial data in a variety of ways: points, lines, polygons, rasters. 

```{r spatial-data-types, out.width = 900, fig.alt = "Diagram showing series of points (GPS locations), lines (roads), and polygons (e.g. countries and regions)", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/spatial_data_types.jpg")

# The sf package

* Package for geospatial data manipulation and analysis that works with features
  * **points** (POINT, MULTIPOINT)
  * **lines** (LINESTRING, MULTILINESTRING)
  * **polygons** (POLYGON, MULTIPOLYGON)
  
```{r spatial-data-types2, out.width = 900, fig.alt = "Diagram showing series of points (GPS locations), lines (roads), and polygons (e.g. countries and regions)", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/spatial_data_types.jpg")

```  

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("lightbulb", style = "solid"), scale = 2)` How do we represent these forms as data?

# Births in North Carolina

--

```{r nc-data, eval = TRUE, messages = FALSE}

nc_df <- st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"))

```

* `st` = spatial type and `.shp` is a common geographic shape file format.

--

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("info-circle", style = "solid"), scale = 1)`  `.shp` files come with a lot of other file types: `.shx`, `.dbf` etc. They all need to be kept together.

```{r nc-str, eval = TRUE}

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("info-circle", style = "solid"), scale = 1)` `str()` shows the structure of the data including the data types: `num`: numeric, `chr`: character, `sfc`: simple feature list column.

# Recap
---

* Spatial data are represented as points, lines, polygons, and rasters.

--

* We can store these spatial features as `geometry` using the `sf` package.

--

* When we are working with spatial data we need to take into account the coordinate reference system.

--

* We can use other information in our data set to create the visual elements of our map.

# Recap


* Leaflet maps are built in layers using `%>%`

* Every leaflet map starts with a base map which we can customize by setting the view, adding provider tiles.

* We choose a geometric shape depending on our spatial data type (e.g. `addPolygons` or `addCircleMarkers`). 

* In choosing a color palette we need to think about our data types and our audience.

 * We can add interactivity to our plot using highlight and labels.

# Choose your own adventure
---

* **Option 1** Create a new map with the births from 1979.
* **Option 2** Change around the different visual elements of the plots. 
* **Option 3** Create a new set of labels for the leaflet map with points.
* **Option 4** Check out the short tutorial on joins. 
* **Option 5** Create a new variable that calculates how many births above or below the average counties are. Choose a palette that will be best to show this.

# Let's create a second map

* Let's create a second map of births in 1979.

* First we'll need to create a new set of labels

```{r labels for second map blank, eval=FALSE}

labels79 <- sprintf(
  "<strong>%s</strong><br/>%g births",
  nc$county, nc$births1974
) %>% lapply(htmltools::HTML)


```

* **Your Turn** Using `names(nc)` to check the column names, change `nc$births1974` to the column which corresponds to number of births in 1979.

```{r labels for second map, echo=FALSE}

labels79 <- sprintf(
  "<strong>%s</strong><br/>%g births",
  nc$county, nc$births1979
) %>% lapply(htmltools::HTML)


```
